# Discord AI Bot

**This is a work in progress**

The end goal is to have a **completely free** AI agent with chat, web search, voice and image generation capabilities all inside a discord bot that you can add to your server.

I'm doing this so I can practice JS and LLM implementation while making something cool.

I might sneak in some Python too if necessary.
